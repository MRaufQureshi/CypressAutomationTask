# Getting Started
Optionally, Run `yarn` to ensure dependencies are installed.

To install the dependencies you're gonna need to authenticate your npm client.
In the command line, install the package dependencies using the command `npm install` or `npm i`

The tests cases are coded in `Typescript`

# Testing Framework 
Cypress

# Local Setup
UnZip this file locally and open it in IDE

# Running E2E tests locally

Run the tests using the command `npm run cypress:open`. This brings the Cypress runner. You can now run the tests.
